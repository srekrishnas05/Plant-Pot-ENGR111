## Hi there, My name is Sre, and here's everything you need to know about my Self Watering Plant Pot Project for ENGR 111! ##

### I built a self watering plant pot that used DHT11 sensors to pick up temperature, humidity, & moisture data in the soil and send an input to a servo motor that allows water to flow when engaged. ###
